TODO
----

- Larger play and record buttons.
- Check source comments.
- Expand this README.
- Neaten up component dimensions.
- Check model/VO names.
- WAVE file should not be built every time, only when recording changes.
- Merge UploadEvent and UploadRequestEvent.
- Are relevant errors being listened to/acted upon?
- Add event metadata.
- Make spinner view generic, show when user clicks on button to SoundCloud authorisation page.
- Listen to resize events and reposition MainView?
- Invalid query strings cause the application to throw an unhandled error.
- Event listeners in views are not removed when view is removed.
- Does not take appropriate action if a microphone is absent/not supported.
